How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The main way to make code readable and adatable is compartmentalizing each section of code, documenting it, and providing in line comments. This will ensure that each part of your code will be very easily understood, this will make it easier for you or someone else to go in and make changes to your code. As for this CRUD module. I displayed this by having each section of my python code very clearly for one particular purpose like: reading in documents or creating new ones.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approach all computer science problems in 3 steps:
Understand: break down the problem, answer questions like: what will this look like when finished? what skills will I need to execute step three? is there anything I do not understand and need to learn?
Plan: draft an easy to read design document to visual completion of project
Execute: actually develope and debug code to complete project.
As for this project in particular, what I didnt understand was MongoDB as a whole. I had never used it before so a majority of my time was learning the proper syntax for both mongodb and the other tool we used, Jupyter Notebook (which I had also never used before)

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientist create the tools that companies like Grazioso Salvare require to run their business. In this project we created software that allowed Grazioso Salvare to track and locate all animals under their care.
